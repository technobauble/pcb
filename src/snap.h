   This should probably include a pointer to the object that was found. If it
   did then there may be no need for the obj_type. The object would also know
   where it is, but the snap point might not actually be where the object it, 
   for example, if we're snapping to a point along a line. One reason to include
   such a pointer would be so that we can avoid snapping to something that's 
   already attached to the crosshair.
 
   What if there isn't an actual object to point to? Like, a grid point for
   example? I guess we return a null pointer if there's no object to be attached
   to...

/*! \brief A structure containing an ordered list of SnapSpecs.
 
    This structure implements a list of SnapSpecs. When an element is added, a
    copy is made in the memory of the structure. This is done in order to keep
    all of the objects to be iterated over in the same region of memory in order
    to keep the iteration fast. The iteration must be fast since the list may be
    iterated through every time the mouse is moved.
 
    When SnapSpecs are added, they are inserted into the list at a position
    according to their priority. The memory is always kept contiguous, so the
    elements after are all shifted down in memory to make room for the new one.
 
    If an element is subsequently removed, the size of the allocated memory is
    not reduced, but the memory is still held. The elements in the list after 
    the one removed are all shifted in memory so that all the elements in the
    list remain contiguous. When the element is removed, \a n is decremented,
    but max is not. Another snap can be added and fill that memory.
